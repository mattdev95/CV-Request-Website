# CV-Request-Website

To allow the requesting of a CV using a web form using JavaScript, JQuery, HTML, CSS and PHP. This website is using procedural JavaScript and JQuery. 

This website was for my Interactive Web Authoring module and I have removed all associated links and passwords. 

To build the images, in the terminal you need to do:
```
  docker-compose up --build -d
```
To then stop your containers:
```
  docker-compose down -v
```
Then load your page in:

 ```
 localhost:8888/web_form.html
 ```
