                  I am Matthew, a computing science at Ulster University. I have my own name
                  on Google, called <cite>saxzphone</cite> and I have a soundcloud and youtube channel.
                  I have a GitHub account were I have my upcoming projects.
                  I am a <strong>24 year old</strong> man from Donegal, who grew up with a farming background.
                  My family are all sciencists, one a farmer, one a psychologist and my brother a physicist.
                  I decided to study computing science through my passion for programming and solving complex problems
                  from a young age. I studied catering, so I could learn vital skills to help me acheive my dreams.

                  <h2 class="h2_style">My cookery journey</h2>
                  I have been cooking since I was four year of age. My dream as a young child was always to setup a <i>restaurant</i>.
                  I started my cookery journey by doing cookery classes at school and loved every minute of it. After finishing school
                  I was not sure what I wanted to do, as I had so many interests. I decided to study Engineering and really enjoyed it.
                  Then I realised this was not for me and moved to study catering. I really enjoyed my time as a chef in a student bistro
                  and cooked, while learning skills and techniques to cook for paying customers. I was in one day a week cooking and later on,
                  was in class doing tests and learning to new ways of cooking. I started working part time at a food truck serving restaurant
                  quality food from a street food truck. I helped out during service and helped at a Christmas market. I learned some very
                  valuable experiences from working outside and how businesses can make a living outdoors.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  I later discovered a job opportunity at my local bakery and asked to do some work experiences. It later became an apprenticeship
                  and I worked there for over 2 years as a baker and cleaner and learned some very valuable skills.
                  I stopped being a baker because my back pain was getting worse and was have an effect on my mental health. I decided to leave
                  catering and went back to study Engineering and then decided to do an BTEC in IT and was awarded full marks.
